The Gendered Double Bind: A Quantitative Analysis of the Disproportionate Obstacles Faced by Female Politicians

Since the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, I have become interested in studying the unique obstacles faced by female politicians due to their gender.  While Hillary Clinton was by no means a perfect candidate, the coverage and evaluation of her electoral race was mired in sexism.  I want to use pre and post debate survey data to analyze how Americans perceived Hillary Clinton’s competence and character.

Summary:  This study employed a survey method to examine American students’ emotional reactions to the first and third presidential debates leading up to the 2016 election. The study used pre and post-test questionnaires as well as facial recognition software that tracked viewers’ expressions in real time during and after the debate. Survey metrics include: subject demographic characteristics, political attitudes, feelings towards the candidates, and tracking of emotional reactions.
